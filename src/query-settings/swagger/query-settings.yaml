      queryCompletedLimit:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        default: 4000
        example: 7000
        description: |
          [[queryCompletedLimit]]
          Sets the number of requests to be logged in the completed requests catalog.
          As new completed requests are added, old ones are removed.

          Increase this when the completed request keyspace is not big enough to track the slow requests, such as when you want a larger sample of slow requests.

          Refer to xref:manage:monitor/monitoring-n1ql-query.adoc#sys-completed-config[Configure the Completed Requests] for more information and examples.

          The {completed-limit-srv}[node-level] `completed-limit` setting specifies this property for a single node.
          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.
      queryCompletedThreshold:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        default: 1000
        example: 7000
        description: |
          [[queryCompletedThreshold]]
          A duration in milliseconds.
          All completed queries lasting longer than this threshold are logged in the completed requests catalog.

          Specify `0` to track all requests, independent of duration.
          Specify any negative number to track none.

          Refer to xref:manage:monitor/monitoring-n1ql-query.adoc#sys-completed-config[Configure the Completed Requests] for more information and examples.

          The {completed-threshold-srv}[node-level] `completed-threshold` setting specifies this property for a single node.
          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.
      queryLogLevel:
        type: string
        default: INFO
        enum: ["DEBUG","TRACE","INFO","WARN","ERROR","SEVERE","NONE"]
        example: DEBUG
        description: |
          [[queryLogLevel]]
          Log level used in the logger.

          All values, in descending order of data:{blank}

          `DEBUG` -- For developers.
          Writes everything.

          `TRACE` -- For developers.
          Less info than `DEBUG`.

          `INFO` -- For admin & customers.
          Lists warnings & errors.

          `WARN` -- For admin.
          Only abnormal items.

          `ERROR` -- For admin.
          Only errors to be fixed.

          `SEVERE` -- For admin.
          Major items, like crashes.

          `NONE` -- Doesnâ€™t write anything.

          The {loglevel-srv}[node-level] `loglevel` setting specifies this property for a single node.
          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.
      queryMaxParallelism:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        default: 1
        example: 0
        description: |
          [[queryMaxParallelism]]
          Specifies the maximum parallelism for queries on all Query nodes in the cluster.

          If the value is zero or negative, the maximum parallelism is restricted to the number of allowed cores.
          Similarly, if the value is greater than the number of allowed cores, the maximum parallelism is restricted to the number of allowed cores.

          (The number of allowed cores is the same as the number of logical CPUs.
          In Community Edition, the number of allowed cores cannot be greater than 4.
          In Enterprise Edition, there is no limit to the number of allowed cores.)

          The {max-parallelism-srv}[node-level] `max_parallelism` setting specifies this property for a single node.
          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.

          In addition, there is a {max_parallelism_req}[request-level] `max_parallelism` parameter.
          If a request includes this parameter, it will be capped by the node-level `max-parallelism` setting.

          [NOTE]
          To enable queries to run in parallel, you must specify the cluster-level `queryMaxParallelism` parameter, or specify the node-level `max-parallelism` parameter on all Query nodes.

          Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index-partitioning.adoc#max-parallelism[Max Parallelism] for more information.

          The {n1ql-feat-ctrl}[node-level] `n1ql-feat-ctrl` setting specifies this property for a single node.
          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.
      queryPipelineBatch:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        default: 16
        example: 64
        description: |
          [[queryPipelineBatch]]

          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.

          In addition, the {pipeline_batch_req}[request-level] `pipeline_batch` parameter specifies this property per request.
          The minimum of that and the node-level `pipeline-batch` setting is applied.
      queryPipelineCap:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        default: 512
        example: 1024
        description: |
          [[queryPipelineCap]]
          Maximum number of items each execution operator can buffer between various operators.

          The {pipeline-cap-srv}[node-level] `pipeline-cap` setting specifies this property for a single node.

        example: 65536
        description: |
          [[queryPreparedLimit]]
          Maximum number of prepared statements in the cache.
          When this cache reaches the limit, the least recently used prepared statements will be discarded as new prepared statements are created.

        description: |
          [[queryScanCap]]
          Maximum buffered channel size between the indexer client and the query service for index scans.
          This parameter controls when to use scan backfill.

          Use `0` or a negative number to disable.
          Smaller values reduce GC, while larger values reduce indexer backfill.

          The {scan-cap-srv}[node-level] `scan-cap` setting specifies this property for a single node.
          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.

          In addition, the {scan_cap_req}[request-level] `scan_cap` parameter specifies this property per request.

          The {timeout-srv}[node-level] `timeout` setting specifies this property for a single node.
          When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.

          In addition, the {timeout_req}[request-level] `timeout` parameter specifies this property per request.
          The minimum of that and the node-level `timeout` setting is applied.

          The cluster-level `queryTimeout` setting is an integer, representing a duration in nanoseconds.
          It must not be delimited by quotes, and must not include a unit.
      queryTmpSpaceDir:
        type: string
        example: "/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/tmp"
        description: |
          [[queryTmpSpaceDir]]
          The path to which the indexer writes temporary backfill files, to store any transient data during query processing.

          The specified path must already exist.
          Only absolute paths are allowed.

          The default path is [.file]`var/lib/couchbase/tmp` within the Couchbase Server installation directory.
      queryTmpSpaceSize:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        default: 5120
        example: 2048
        description: |
          [[queryTmpSpaceSize]]
          The maximum size of temporary backfill files (MB).

          Setting the size to `0` disables backfill.
          Setting the size to `-1` means the size is unlimited.

          The maximum size is limited only by the available disk space.
      queryCurlWhitelist:
        description: |
          [[queryCurlWhitelist]]
          An object which determines which URLs may be accessed by the `CURL()` function.
        $ref: "#/definitions/Access"

  Access:
    type: object
    required:
      - all_access
    properties:
      all_access:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          Defines whether the user has access to all URLs, or only URLs specified by the access list.

          This field set must be set to `false` to enable the [.param]`allowed_urls` and [.param]`disallowed_urls` fields.

          Setting this field to `true` enables access to all endpoints.
      allowed_urls:
        type: array
        description: |
          An array of strings, each of which is a URL to which you wish to grant access.
          Each URL is a prefix match.
          The CURL() function will allow any URL that starts with this value.

          For example, if you wish to allow access to all Google APIs, add the URL `+++https://maps.googleapis.com+++` to the array.
          To allow complete access to `localhost`, use `+++http://localhost+++`.

          Note that each URL must include the port, protocol, and all other components of the URL.
        default: []
        items:
          type: string
      disallowed_urls:
        type: array
        description: |
          An array of strings, each of which is a URL that will be restricted for all roles.
          Each URL is a prefix match.
          The CURL() function will disallow any URL that starts with this value.

          If both [.param]`allowed_urls` and [.param]`disallowed_urls` fields are populated, the [.param]`disallowed_urls` field takes precedence over [.param]`allowed_urls`.

          Note that each URL must include the port, protocol, and all other components of the URL.
        default: []
        items:
          type: string
