You can also retrieve the number of Analytic replicas using the [Couchbase Web Console][1] or the [CLI][2].
For further details about Analytics replicas, refer to [Rebalance][3] and [Hard Failover][4].

[3]: ../learn/clusters-and-availability/rebalance.html#rebalancing-the-analytics-service
[4]: ../learn/clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.html#hard-failover-and-the-analytics-service

NOTE: A rebalance is required for a new `numReplicas` value to take effect.
