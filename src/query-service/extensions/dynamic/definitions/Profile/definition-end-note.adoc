[TIP]
====
The `kernTime`, `servTime`, and `execTime` statistics can be very helpful in troubleshooting query performance issues.
For example:

* A high `servTime` for a low number of items processed is an indication that the indexer or KV store is stressed.
* A high `kernTime` means there is a downstream issue in the query plan or the query server having many requests to process, so the scheduled waiting time will be more for CPU time.
