== Overview
The Functions REST API is a secondary API provided by the Query service. This API enables you to manage the JavaScript libraries and objects that are used to create N1QL user-defined functions.

The API schemes and host URLs are as follows:

* `http://node:8093/`
* `https://node:18093/` (for secure access)

where `node` is the host name or IP address of a computer running the N1QL query engine.
