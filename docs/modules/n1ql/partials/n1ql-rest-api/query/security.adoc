[[_securityscheme]]
== Security

The Query Service API accepts credentials via HTTP basic authentication header, or via the `creds` request parameter.
If a request contains both HTTP basic authentication header and a `creds` parameter, the `creds` parameter is ignored and only the HTTP basic authentication header is used for authenticating.


[[_header]]
=== Header
Specify a user name and password via HTTP headers.
This method can only be used to provide a single credential.

__Type__ : basic


[[_parameter]]
=== Parameter
Specify user names and passwords via the `creds` request parameter. This is the only method that can provide multiple credentials for a request.

### RBAC Role
// Use Markdown-style headings to avoid offset

Users must have the relevant _Administrative_ or _Query & Index_ RBAC roles, depending on the types of query they intend to run.
In addition, users must have permissions on the required buckets, scopes, and collections, where appropriate.
Refer to xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles] for more details.
