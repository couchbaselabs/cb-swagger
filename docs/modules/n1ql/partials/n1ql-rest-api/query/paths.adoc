|HTTP Code|Description|Schema

|**400**|Bad Request. The request cannot be processed for one of the following reasons:

|**401**|Unauthorized. The credentials provided with the request are missing or invalid.|No Content
|**403**|Forbidden. There is a read-only violation. Either there was an attempt to create or update in a GET request or a POST request where `readonly` is set, or the client does not have the authorization to modify an object (index, keyspace or namespace) in the statement.|No Content

|**409**|Conflict. There is an attempt to create an object (keyspace or index) that already exists.|No Content

==== Example HTTP request

[[example-1]]
====
POST request with parameters as form data

.Curl request
[source,sh]
----
curl -v http://localhost:8093/query/service \
     -d 'statement=SELECT name FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel LIMIT 1' \
     -u Administrator:password
----

Because it is sent as form data, the statement in this example avoids using a semicolon.
====

[[example-2]]
====
POST request with parameters in JSON format

.Curl request
[source,sh]
----
curl http://localhost:8093/query/service \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{ "statement": "SELECT name FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel LIMIT 1;" }' \
    -u Administrator:password
----

Conversely, because it is sent as a JSON object, the statement in this example can contain a semicolon.

[[_get_service]]
=== Read-Only Query Service
....
GET /query/service
....


==== Description
Enables you to execute a SQL++ statement. This method allows you to run queries and modifying statements, and specify query parameters. It does not allow you to run modifying statements.

This endpoint is intended for situations where use of the `POST` method is restricted.


#### Parameters
// Use Markdown-style headings to avoid offset

For GET requests, you specify the parameters in the query URL in URL-encoded format.
For URL-encoded parameters, the format is consistent with the syntax for variables according to the RFC 6570.

For a table of parameters that can be passed in a GET request to the `/query/service` endpoint, refer to <<_request_parameters>>.
