### RBAC Role
// Use Markdown-style headings to avoid offset

Users must have the relevant _Administrative_ or _Query & Index_ RBAC roles, depending on the types of query they intend to run.
In addition, users must have permissions on the required buckets, scopes, and collections, where appropriate.
