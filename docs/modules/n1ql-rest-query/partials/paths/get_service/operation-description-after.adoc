= Parameters

For GET requests, you specify the parameters in the query URL in URL-encoded format.
For URL-encoded parameters, the format is consistent with the syntax for variables according to the RFC 6570.

For a table of parameters that can be passed in a GET request to the `/query/service` endpoint, refer to <<Request>>.
