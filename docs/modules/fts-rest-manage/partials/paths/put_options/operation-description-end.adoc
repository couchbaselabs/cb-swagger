The Search Service automatically partitions its indexes across all Search nodes in the cluster, ensuring optimal distribution, following rebalance.

To achieve this, in versions of Couchbase Server prior to 7.1, by default, partitions needing to be newly created were entirely built, on their newly assigned nodes.
In 7.1+, by default, new partitions are created by the transfer of partition files from old nodes to new nodes: this significantly enhances performance.
This is an Enterprise-only feature, which requires all Search Service nodes either to be running 7.1 or later; or to be running 7.0.2, with the feature explicitly switched on by means of this endpoint.
Note that users of 7.1+ can explicitly switch the feature off by means of this endpoint; in which case partition build is used to establish new partitions, rather than file transfer.

During file transfer, should an unresolvable error occur, file transfer is automatically abandoned, and partition build is used instead.
