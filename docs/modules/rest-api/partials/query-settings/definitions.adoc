[options="header", cols=".^3a,.^11a,.^4a"]
|===
|Name|Description|Schema
|**queryCleanupClientAttempts** +
__optional__|[#queryCleanupClientAttempts]
When enabled, the Query service preferentially aims to clean up just transactions that it has created, leaving transactions for the distributed cleanup process only when it is forced to.

The <<cleanupclientattempts,node-level>> `cleanupclientattempts` setting specifies this property for a single node.
When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster. +
**Default** : `true` +
**Example** : `false`|boolean
|**queryCleanupLostAttempts** +
__optional__|[#queryCleanupLostAttempts]
When enabled, the Query service takes part in the distributed cleanup process, and cleans up expired transactions created by any client.

The <<cleanuplostattempts,node-level>> `cleanuplostattempts` setting specifies this property for a single node.
When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster. +

__optional__|[#queryCleanupWindow]
Specifies how frequently the Query service checks its subset of link:/server/7.7/learn/data/transactions.html#active-transaction-record-entries[active transaction records] for cleanup.
Decreasing this setting causes expiration transactions to be found more swiftly, with the tradeoff of increasing the number of reads per second used for the scanning process.

The value for this setting is a string.
Its format includes an amount and a mandatory unit, e.g. `10ms` (10 milliseconds) or `0.5s` (half a second).
Valid units are:

* `ns` (nanoseconds)
* `us` (microseconds)
* `ms` (milliseconds)
* `s` (seconds)
* `m` (minutes)
* `h` (hours)

|**queryCompletedLimit** +
__optional__|[#queryCompletedLimit]
Sets the number of requests to be logged in the completed requests catalog.
As new completed requests are added, old ones are removed.

Increase this when the completed request keyspace is not big enough to track the slow requests, such as when you want a larger sample of slow requests.

Refer to link:/server/7.7/manage/monitor/monitoring-n1ql-query.html#sys-completed-config[Configure the Completed Requests] for more information and examples.

The <<completed-limit,node-level>> `completed-limit` setting specifies this property for a single node.

|**queryCompletedMaxPlanSize** +
__optional__|[#queryCompletedMaxPlanSize]
A plan size in bytes.
Limits the size of query execution plans that can be logged in the completed requests catalog.
Values larger than the maximum limit are silently treated as the maximum limit.
Queries with plans larger than this are not logged.
You must obtain execution plans for such queries via profiling or using the EXPLAIN statement.

Refer to link:/server/7.7/manage/monitor/monitoring-n1ql-query.html#sys-completed-config[Configure the Completed Requests] for more information.

The <<completed-max-plan-size,node-level>> `completed-max-plan-size` setting specifies this property for a single node.

Less info than `DEBUG`.

* `INFO` &mdash; For admin &amp; customers.
Lists warnings &amp; errors.

* `WARN` &mdash; For admin.
Only abnormal items.

* `ERROR` &mdash; For admin.
Only errors to be fixed.

* `SEVERE` &mdash; For admin.
Major items, like crashes.

* `NONE` &mdash; Doesn't write anything.

|**queryMaxParallelism** +
__optional__|[#queryMaxParallelism]
Specifies the maximum parallelism for queries on all Query nodes in the cluster.

If the value is zero or negative, the maximum parallelism is restricted to the number of allowed cores.
Similarly, if the value is greater than the number of allowed cores, the maximum parallelism is restricted to the number of allowed cores.

(The number of allowed cores is the same as the number of logical CPUs.
In Community Edition, the number of allowed cores cannot be greater than 4.

NOTE: To enable queries to run in parallel, you must specify the cluster-level `queryMaxParallelism` parameter, or specify the node-level `max-parallelism` parameter on all Query nodes.

Refer to link:/server/7.7/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/index-partitioning.html#max-parallelism[Max Parallelism] for more information. +

**Example** : `0`|integer (int32)
|**queryMemoryQuota** +
__optional__|[#queryMemoryQuota]
Specifies the maximum amount of memory a request may use on any Query node in the cluster, in MB.

This parameter enforces a ceiling on the memory used for the tracked documents required for processing a request.

Within a transaction, this setting enforces the memory quota for the transaction by tracking the
delta table and the transaction log (approximately).

The <<memory-quota-srv,node-level>> `memory-quota` setting specifies this property for a single node.
When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.

**Example** : `512`|integer (int32)
|**queryNumCpus** +
__optional__|[#queryNumCpus]
The number of CPUs the Query service can use on any Query node in the cluster.
Note that this setting requires a restart of the Query service to take effect.

When set to `0` (the default), the Query service can use all available CPUs, up to the limits described below.

The number of CPUs can never be greater than the number of logical CPUs.
In Community Edition, the number of allowed CPUs cannot be greater than 4.

The <<use-replica-srv,node-level>> `use-replica` setting specifies this property for a single node.
When you change the cluster-level setting, the node-level setting is over-written for all nodes in the cluster.

In addition, the <<use_replica_req,request-level>> `use_replica` parameter specifies this property per request.
If a request does not include this parameter, or if the request-level parameter is `unset`, the node-level setting is used.
If the request-level parameter and the node-level setting are both `unset`, read from replica is disabled for that request.

Do not enable read from replica when you require consistent results.
Only SELECT queries that are not within a transaction can read from replica.

Reading from replica is only possible if the cluster uses Couchbase Server 7.6.0 or later.

Note that KV range scans cannot currently be started on a replica vBucket.
