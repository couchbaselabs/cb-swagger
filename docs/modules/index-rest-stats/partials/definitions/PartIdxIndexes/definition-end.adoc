[NOTE]
====
By default, the name of the nested object has the form `<keyspace>:<index>`.

* `<keyspace>` is the bucket, scope, and collection containing the index.
* `<index>` is the name of the index.

If the `redact` query parameter was set to `true`, the name of the nested object is replaced by the index instance ID for confidentiality.
