[NOTE]
====
The name of the nested object has the form `Partition-<num>`.

* If the index is partitioned, this object contains statistics for one index partition, where `<num>` is the partition number.
* If the index is not partitioned, this object contains statistics for the entire index, and `<num>` is `0`.
