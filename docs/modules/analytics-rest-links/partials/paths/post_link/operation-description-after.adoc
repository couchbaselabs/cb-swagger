When creating or altering a remote link using an alternate address, note the following:

* At least one node in the remote cluster must expose the `mgmt` port (`rest_port`, default 8091) or the `mgmtSSL` port (`ssl_rest_port`, default 18091).
* Furthermore, *all* data nodes in the remote cluster must expose the `kv` port (`memcached_port`, default 11210) or the `kvSSL` port (`memcached_ssl_port`, default 11207).

Failure to do so will result in a 400 (Bad Request) error.

NOTE: The SSL ports are required when the **encryption** mode is set to `full`; the non-SSL ports are required otherwise.

CAUTION: When creating an external link, be sure to follow best practices for security.
Root account credentials should never be used.
It is recommended to grant the minimum possible permissions to perform the required operations, and only to allow access to the required data and resources.
