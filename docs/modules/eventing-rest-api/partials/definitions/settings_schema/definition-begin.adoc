[.status]#Couchbase Server 7.6.4#

The `allow_sync_documents` setting is available in Couchbase Server 7.6.4 and later.

* By default, this setting is `true`, for compatibility with previous versions of Couchbase Server.

* When this setting is `false`, the specified function skips all documents with IDs prefixed with `_sync`.
This enables the function to work with Sync Gateway.

For examples, see <<ex-sync-gateway-global>> and <<ex-sync-gateway-scoped>>.
