[NOTE]
.Interbucket Recursion
====
If you need to turn off infinite recursion protection for Eventing functions, you can use an alternative REST API endpoint to enable interbucket recursion.
For details, see xref:eventing:troubleshooting-best-practices.adoc#cyclicredun[Troubleshooting and Best Practices].

Allowing interbucket recursion is highly discouraged unless you have an advanced use case and follow strict non-production coding and verification.
