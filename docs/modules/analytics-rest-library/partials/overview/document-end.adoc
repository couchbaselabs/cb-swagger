The API schemes and host URLs are as follows:

* `pass:c[http://node:8095/]`
* `pass:c[https://node:18095/]` (for secure access)

where `node` is the host name or IP address of a node running the Analytics service.
Note that this API is only available on the loopback interface of a node running the Analytics service.
