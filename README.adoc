= Couchbase Swagger Project

This project uses the https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/plugins/#gradle[OpenAPI Generator Gradle Plugin] to convert the OpenAPI specifications for Couchbase Server Developer REST APIs into AsciiDoctor documentation.

== Usage guide

This repository handles several OpenAPI subprojects.
Each subproject is stored in its own subfolder within the `src` folder.

=== Build Script

Within each subproject there is a gradle build script with a `.gradle` extension.
The gradle build script specifies the locations of the OpenAPI source file, any additional AsciiDoc content, and the output AsciiDoc files.

The `build.gradle` script in the root project folder calls the gradle build scripts from each subproject.

Some subprojects are not currently ready to be built.
These do not have a gradle build script.

=== OpenAPI Specification

Within each subproject, the OpenAPI Specification (JSON or YAML) is stored in a folder called `swagger`.
(For some subprojects, the OpenAPI specification file may be stored remotely, i.e. alongside the development source files.)

=== AsciiDoc Content

Each generated AsciiDoc page is stored in its own folder in the `docs` folder.
(In Antora terms, each generated AsciiDoc page is stored in its own module.)
For each subproject, additional AsciiDoc content may be stored in the `partials` folder and its subfolders.

=== Convert a single subproject

[subs="normal"]
----
./gradlew _project_:openApiGenerate --rerun-tasks
----

Where `_project_` is the subproject that you want to convert, for example, `admin`.

=== Convert all projects

[subs="normal"]
----
./gradlew --rerun-tasks
