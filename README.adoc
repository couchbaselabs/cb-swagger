= Couchbase Swagger Project

This project uses the https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup-gradle-plugin[swagger2markup-gradle-plugin] to convert the Swagger specifications for Couchbase REST APIs into AsciiDoctor documentation.

== Usage guide

This repository handles several Swagger subprojects.
Each subproject is stored in its own subfolder within the `src` folder.

=== Build Script

Within each subproject there is a gradle build script with a `.gradle` extension.
The gradle build script specifies the locations of the Swagger source file, any additional AsciiDoc content, and the output AsciiDoc files.

The `build.gradle` script in the root project folder calls the gradle build scripts from each subproject.

Some subprojects are not currently ready to be built.
These do not have a gradle build script.

=== Swagger Specification

Within each subproject, the Swagger Specification (JSON or YAML) is stored in a folder called `swagger`.
(For some subprojects, the Swagger specification file may be stored remotely, i.e. alongside the development source files.)

=== AsciiDoc Content

For each subproject, additional AsciiDoc content may be stored in the folder `asciidoc/extensions` and its subfolders.

=== Convert a single subproject

[subs="normal"]
----
./gradlew _project_:convertSwagger2markup --rerun-tasks
----

Where `_project_` is the subproject that you want to convert, for example, `admin`.

=== Convert all projects

[subs="normal"]
----
./gradlew --rerun-tasks
